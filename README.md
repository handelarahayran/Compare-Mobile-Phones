# Mobile Price Classification

This project aims to classify mobile prices based on various features using different machine learning models. The project applies Regression, Neural Network, and Random Forest algorithms on different versions of the dataset (original, augmented, reduced). The model performances are evaluated using k-fold cross validation.
